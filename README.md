MoGua is a modern community-centric green cryptocurrency based on a proof-of-space-and-time consensus algorithm. It is a community-supported fork of the [Chia Network](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain) codebase. MoGua reduces the pre-farm value by increasing the block reward by 10~50 times. You can earn more money today. For more information, see our website and downloads at https://mogua.mog.

* [Proof of space and time](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tmRIb7lgi4QfKkNaxuKOBHRmwbVlGL4f7EsBDr_5xZE/edit) based consensus which allows anyone to farm with commodity hardware
* Very easy to use full node and farmer GUI and cli (thousands of nodes active on mainnet)
* Simplified UTXO based transaction model, with small on-chain state
* Lisp-style Turing-complete functional [programming language](https://chialisp.com/) for money related use cases
* BLS keys and aggregate signatures (only one signature per block)
* Support for light clients with fast, objective syncing
* A growing community of farmers and developers around the world
